# FP30playground

Test the app here: [https://jjulio.github.io/FP30playground/](https://jjulio.github.io/FP30playground/)

You could play a lot of new sounds and settings (effect types,reverbs,chorus,pitch bend, modulation,sound envelope settings...)
This app uses a Midi loopback to receive the midi notes of the FP30 and send back again with the posibility to select a lot of new sounds and settings!
By default it switches off the internal sound generator (main keyboard midi local off) but you could play with this enabled also if you want a layered sound.

This app works with the piano connected with USB cable (with bluetooth connection the lag is very bad). For Android use an OTG cable to connect your piano and for ipad use the camera adapter(USB).

This app works on PC (chrome browser) and Android(chrome browser).
for ipad (IOS) users you could download the free web midi browser app, open the address bar (at top) and copy the app url. You could save the url on the favourites (middle bottom button) (and if it´s the first one it will open with the app).

*Note1:* When you disconnect the app probably your fp30 doesn't sound. This is because the midi local off. You could enable with Function+F1(the more lower F key) or simple switch off/on your keyboard with the power on/off button.
*Note2:* Some of the sound envolope settings (attack, release, cutoff...) does not work on all sounds (for example this don´t work on piano sounds)

This is an experimental work and it´ss based on the paino midi implementation and other internet sources. Special thanks to Picman for his inital help and for the sounds file. It uses the webmidi interface.
Have fun!

*This app is not official, so play at your own risk*
